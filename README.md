In order to increase the reliability and the availability of Cloud providerâ€™s resources, we propose a distributed
approach of Cloud federation to overcome the limited resources of the Cloud provider. To do this, we introduce
a new layer within each Cloud provider named Federation Interface. This latter allows the provider to
establish a federation with the others. The interaction between different Cloud providers within the same federation
is established by using a multi-agent system.
